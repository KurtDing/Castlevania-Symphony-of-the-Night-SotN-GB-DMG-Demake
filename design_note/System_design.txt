Control system  X-X!V''Q

There are 4 bottons only, will rearrange botton definition  
botton A/B is attack/jamp, shield block no longer exist  
keep start botton as status menu

Select botton becomes multifunctional including regular map.
Select + ↑ = shield spell or item rush
Select + ↓ = mist shifting
Select + → = wolf shifting
Select + ← = bat shifting

All the command move is acheivable, cross pad + attack botton.
Backdash is too classic, might use ->-> / <-<- or A+B to acheive.
